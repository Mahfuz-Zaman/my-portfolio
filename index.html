            <h2 class="text-color">Become a web developer</h2>
            <p class="text-color">As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I grew older and my
                interests changed,
                my dream profession changed also. Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one
                occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged as the dream I passionately pursue.
                It all started when my grandparents purchased their first computer. Being as this was the first computer
                I had ever used, I did not know how to use it very well. I mostly used it for games, which my grandma
                would set up for me to play. I also drew pictures with the computer's paint program, the functionality
                of which, unfortunately, was very limited. The relatively new computer industry's technology could not
                produce enough colors to portray very realistic pictures. Despite this fact, I spent many contented
                hours creating images on my grandparent's computer.
